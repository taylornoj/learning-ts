We can use both ```interface``` and ```type``` keywords to declare types

```Interface``` is great for typing objects, especially within OOP

We can apply an ```interface``` on a class using the ```implements``` keyword

Object types can be nested infinitely

We can copy the type members of one interface into another using the ```extends``` keyword

We can define variable property names within an object type with an ```index signature```  - syntax as such:

 ```[propertyName: string]: string```


It is possible to make some type members optional by using ```?``` - syntax as such:

```name?: string```
