# Type Shapes

Because TypeScript knows what types our objects are, it also knows what shapes our objects adhere to

An objects shape describes what properties and methods it does or doesn't contain (among other things)

The built-in types in JavaScript each have known properties and methods that always exist. For example:

- strings; all have a ```.length``` property and a ```.toLowerCase()``` method
